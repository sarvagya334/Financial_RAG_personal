--- ANSWER ---

**Summary**

The inflation rate in Singapore is not explicitly mentioned in the provided sources. However, the sources do provide information on interest rates, which can be used to infer the direction of inflation.

**Step-by-step reasoning**

1. The sources provide data on interest rates, including the Interbank Overnight Rate, Interbank 1-Week Rate, and Interbank 1-Month Rate.
2. These interest rates can be used to infer the direction of inflation. For example, a rising overnight rate can indicate a tightening monetary policy, which can help combat inflation.
3. However, the sources do not provide explicit information on inflation rates or inflation sensitivity.

**Calculations**

No calculations are required for this question.

**Assumptions**

1. The assumption is made that the interest rates provided in the sources are indicative of the direction of inflation.
2. The assumption is also made that the sources do not provide explicit information on inflation rates or inflation sensitivity.

**Sources cited**

1. [Source 1] to [Source 8]

**Confidence level**

Medium. The confidence level is medium because while the sources provide information on interest rates, they do not provide explicit information on inflation rates or inflation sensitivity.
